# PassABill

This program is a simplified simulation of congress. It is supposed to show the process of making a bill into a law and how partisanship in congress effects the process. It takes the user input to determine the ratio of D and R in congress and whether or not the president is a D or R. It also asks the user to list their party as the politician introducing legislation. Based off of all the information the bill could be passed through congress or not, it can be vetoed or passed by the president. If it is vetoed congress has another vote on it and they can override the president. The results of all this is visualized.
